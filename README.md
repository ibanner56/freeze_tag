#The Problem
Imagine a swarm of robots on the plane, such that all but one robot are "asleep" or in stand-by mode.
To awaken a robot, a currently active robot must go to its location on the plane.
Once a sleeping robot is awakened, it may assist in waking other sleeping robots.
Our presentation deck including a more in-depth problem statement can be found here.

#The Objective
Assuming general position principle, awaken every robot in the swarm in the shortest possible period of time.
The general case of the Freeze Tag Problem is NP-hard.
